<h2>PoshZone Demo</h2>

<div>Please install this version of <a href="operator.xpi">operator</a> into Firefox for this demo. I haven't been able to set the mime type of the file on the server so you will have to save it to disk and then open it in Firefox to install it as a plugin. Next you will need to register poshZone as a <a href="poshZone.js">dataformat</a> and then add some sample poshZone <a href="poshZoneSampleActions.js">actions</a> into operator. </div> More detailed steps <a href="http://poshzone.wikidot.com/startusing">here</a>
<div>
    The content below is marked up using poshZones. Once you have restarted FireFox and reloaded this page you should see <em>poshZone(4)</em> highlighted in your operator toolbar.</div>
